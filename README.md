- **Kimi K2 & Kimi VL** — MoonshotAI's open-source Kimi models are fully supported: Kimi K2 (1T/32B active MoE) via Ollama GGUF (Q3/Q4/Q5) for every tier, and Kimi VL A3B (vision-language, 3B active) via TurboQuant for multimodal scene analysis.
- **All data local** — Files stored in OPFS (Origin Private File System). Nothing leaves the browser or your server.
- **Docker-ready** — One command to start the full stack. BuildKit cache mounts, CPU-only PyTorch wheels, and parallel builds keep rebuilds fast.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**All setups:**

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with BuildKit support and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v2.3+

**GPU setup (optional, NVIDIA only):**

- NVIDIA driver installed on the host (`nvidia-smi` must work on the host first)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) so Docker can expose the GPU to containers
- Recommended: CUDA 13+ driver for the `cuTile` kernel path used by TurboQuant (older drivers still work — they just fall back to the PyTorch KV-compression path)

> Docker is optional but recommended for running the database, Redis, and AI backend. Frontend-only development works without it.

### Install and Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ekaanth/OpenCut-AI.git
   cd OpenCut-AI
   ```

2. Copy the environment file:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

3. Start the database, Redis, and AI backend. **Pick one of the two startup modes below.**

   **Option A — CPU (default, works on any machine):**

   ```bash
   # Enable BuildKit for faster builds with cache mounts
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

   # Build shared base images first, then all services in parallel
   docker compose build --parallel
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   **Option B — NVIDIA GPU (turboquant-service runs on CUDA with cuTile kernels):**

   ```bash
   # Verify the host can see the GPU first
   nvidia-smi

   # Enable BuildKit for faster builds with cache mounts
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

   # Build + start everything with the GPU override file layered on top
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d --build

   # Confirm the turboquant-service container actually sees the GPU
   docker compose exec turboquant-service nvidia-smi

   # Confirm the service reports GPU mode
   curl http://localhost:8430/health | jq '{compute_mode, backend, turboquant_engine_available}'
   # Expected: {"compute_mode": "cuda", "backend": "gpu", "turboquant_engine_available": true}
   ```

   If `nvidia-smi` fails on the host, install the NVIDIA driver first. If it works on the host but fails inside the container, install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) and restart the Docker daemon (`sudo systemctl restart docker`).

4. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   bun install
   bun dev:web
   ```

The editor will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Switching between CPU and GPU later?** You can toggle at runtime from the editor's **Settings → AI Optimization → Compute Mode** panel — no need to tear down Docker. If you started with Option A (CPU) and later want GPU, stop the stack (`docker compose down`) and restart with Option B.

### Docker Build Optimizations

All services are self-contained Dockerfiles that build in parallel without dependency ordering issues. BuildKit cache mounts share downloaded packages across services automatically.

**Key optimizations:**

| Technique | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **CPU-only PyTorch** | ~8GB less to download across 4 services (~200MB vs ~2GB CUDA each) |
| **BuildKit cache mounts** | uv/pip download cache survives across rebuilds — code-only changes skip dep installs entirely |
| **Parallel builds** | `docker compose build --parallel` builds all services concurrently |
| **Per-service .dockerignore** | Smaller build contexts, faster COPY operations |
| **Layer-ordered Dockerfiles** | `requirements.txt` copied before source code — dep layer stays cached when only code changes |

**Rebuilding after code changes:**

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker compose build --parallel
docker compose up -d
```

On subsequent builds, only the `COPY . .` layer and below is rebuilt. The dependency install layers are served from the BuildKit cache unless `requirements.txt` or `requirements.lock` changes.

### AI Backend

The AI backend runs as a FastAPI service on port 8420. It powers transcription, image generation, voice cloning, TTS, audio analysis, LLM commands, YouTube-to-Reels processing, and engagement scoring.

```bash
# Start with Docker (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# Or run standalone
cd services/ai-backend
python run.py
```

Configure AI models in the **Settings > AI Models** panel inside the editor.

#### Optional dependencies

| Dependency               | Purpose                                 | Required?                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Redis                    | Job queue for YouTube-to-Reels pipeline | Optional (falls back to in-memory) |
| yt-dlp                   | YouTube video downloading               | Required for YouTube-to-Reels      |
| Google OAuth credentials | YouTube channel ownership verification  | Optional                           |

#### Python package management (uv)

All seven Python services (ai-backend, turboquant-service, whisper-service, tts-service, image-service, speaker-service, face-service) use [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Astral's Rust-based Python package manager — instead of pip. uv resolves and installs 10–100× faster than pip, so cold-cache Docker builds of the heavy services (torch, transformers, bitsandbytes) finish in seconds instead of minutes.

Each service has two files that define its dependencies:

- **`requirements.txt`** — the editable source of truth. Add / remove / pin packages here.
- **`requirements.lock`** — the full transitive closure, autogenerated from `requirements.txt` via `uv pip compile --universal`. Commit this file; the Dockerfile installs from it for reproducible builds.

After editing a `requirements.txt`, regenerate the matching lockfile:

```bash
# Install uv once on your host (or `brew install uv`)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Regenerate the lockfile for the service you edited
uv pip compile services/<service-name>/requirements.txt \
  -o services/<service-name>/requirements.lock \
  --python-version 3.11 \
  --universal
```

`--universal` is important — it produces a platform-independent lockfile that preserves PEP 508 markers (e.g. `bitsandbytes>=0.43.0 ; platform_system != "Darwin"` in the turboquant-service) so the same lockfile works whether you generate it on macOS or run it inside a Linux container. Without `--universal`, packages gated off your current platform are dropped from the lockfile entirely.

Inside Dockerfiles, uv runs with `--system --no-cache`: system-site-packages (safe because each container is already isolated) and no install cache (the Docker layer cache handles that). The GPU extras for TurboQuant are **not** in the lockfile — they're layered on top via the `TURBOQUANT_EXTRAS=gpu` build arg from [`docker-compose.gpu.yml`](docker-compose.gpu.yml).

**Platform note — face-service runs on linux/amd64.** Six of the seven services build natively for whatever arch your Docker daemon defaults to (arm64 on Apple Silicon, amd64 on Intel/AMD Linux). The exception is **face-service**, which pins `FROM --platform=linux/amd64` because `mediapipe` does not publish aarch64 Linux wheels — only `manylinux_2_28_x86_64`, `macosx_arm64`, and `win_amd64`. On Apple Silicon hosts Docker runs face-service through Rosetta emulation (slower startup, fine at steady state). If mediapipe eventually ships aarch64 Linux wheels, drop the `--platform=linux/amd64` line from `services/face-service/Dockerfile` and the container will run natively.

> **Reverting to pip** is a one-line change per Dockerfile: replace `uv pip install --system --no-cache` with `pip install --no-cache-dir` and delete the `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.9.28 ...` line. Lockfiles can stay committed — pip ignores them.

### TurboQuant: Compute Mode (CPU / GPU)

The TurboQuant inference service supports both CPU and NVIDIA GPU execution, with **two completely separate backend implementations** tuned for each device.

| Backend            | Compression path                                          | Decode path                                                    | "Turbo boost" strategy                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GPUTurboBackend`  | `turboquant-gpu` cuTile fused kernels, **2-bit** or 3-bit | Full `engine.generate()` through the compressed KV cache       | TF32 matmul, cuDNN benchmark, `auto_tune()` warm-up           |
| `CPUTurboBackend`  | PyTorch fallback, **3-bit** only (2-bit decode is lossy)  | Plain HF `model.generate` (greedy fallback too slow on CPU)   | Physical-core thread pinning, MKLDNN, single warm-up probe   |

The backends live in [`services/turboquant-service/compute_backends.py`](services/turboquant-service/compute_backends.py) behind a common `BaseTurboBackend` interface, so application code never branches on device type. The factory `create_turbo_backend(device=...)` picks the right one automatically — and if a GPU backend fails to initialize (e.g. `cuda-tile` not installed, CUDA driver too old), it falls back to the CPU backend with a warning rather than crashing.

#### Choosing Compute Mode in the UI

Open the editor → **Settings → AI Optimization → Compute Mode** and pick one of:

- **Auto** — detect the fastest device (CUDA → MPS → CPU). Default for every existing user.
- **CPU** — force CPU inference. Works on any host; `CPUTurboBackend` kicks in.
- **GPU (CUDA)** — force NVIDIA GPU. Button is greyed out (with a tooltip) when no GPU is detected.

The selector shows a live "Running on: `<device>`" status line and a badge with the **actual** KV compression ratio from the most recent inference request. Selecting a new mode writes `OPENCUTAI_AI_COMPUTE_MODE` to `.env`, reloads the in-memory backend config, and reloads the model on the new device.

#### Running with a GPU (Docker) — reference

See **Getting Started → Install and Run Locally → Option B** above for the quickstart. This section is the deeper reference.

**What the GPU override file does**

[`docker-compose.gpu.yml`](docker-compose.gpu.yml) is a standard Compose override layered on top of the base file. It changes three things for the `turboquant-service`:

1. **Reserves a GPU device** via `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` with `driver: nvidia`, `count: 1`, `capabilities: [gpu]`. This is the modern Compose v2.3+ syntax; older `runtime: nvidia` setups need to be updated.
2. **Passes `TURBOQUANT_EXTRAS=gpu`** as a build arg, which makes the turboquant-service Dockerfile run `uv pip install --system "turboquant-gpu[gpu]" --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com`. This pulls in the cuTile kernel extras from NVIDIA's PyPI mirror.
3. **Pins `DEVICE=cuda`** (instead of `auto`) so the container always comes up in GPU mode. Remove that override line if you want the UI Compute Mode toggle to drive the device.

**First-time startup**

```bash
# 1. Make sure the host + Docker can see the GPU
nvidia-smi
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi

# 2. Bring up the stack with the GPU override
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d --build

# 3. Verify the turboquant-service picked up the GPU
docker compose exec turboquant-service nvidia-smi
docker compose logs turboquant-service | grep -E "Compute mode|TurboQuantEngine|GPUTurboBackend"

# 4. Verify via the HTTP health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:8430/health | jq
#   "compute_mode": "cuda",
#   "backend": "gpu",
#   "backend_effective_bits": 2,
#   "turboquant_engine_available": true,
#   "gpu_available": true
```

**Managing the stack**

```bash
# Tail logs for just the turboquant-service
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml logs -f turboquant-service

# Restart just the turboquant-service (e.g. after changing env vars)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d --force-recreate turboquant-service

# Stop everything
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml down
```

> Tip: export `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.gpu.yml` in your shell so you don't have to repeat `-f` on every command.

**Troubleshooting**

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Build fails on `uv pip install turboquant-gpu[gpu]`                                  | Host's CUDA driver is older than 13.0, so `cuda-tile` isn't available   | Either upgrade the driver, or drop the `TURBOQUANT_EXTRAS: gpu` build arg (the engine still works via the PyTorch fallback — you just lose cuTile kernels) |
| `/health` shows `"compute_mode": "cpu"` even with the override file                  | Container couldn't see the GPU at startup                               | Check `docker compose exec turboquant-service nvidia-smi`; if that fails, the toolkit/driver isn't wired up                                                |
| Generation works but `compression_ratio` is always `null`                            | `temperature > 0` requests use the sampling fallback path               | Set `temperature=0` in the request to route through `engine.generate()` and get real compression metrics                                                   |
| `RuntimeError: GPUTurboBackend requires CUDA` in turboquant-service logs at startup  | Someone pinned `DEVICE=cuda` on a host without CUDA                     | Unset `DEVICE` or set it to `auto` — the CPU backend will take over                                                                                        |

**Graceful degradation**

The factory in `compute_backends.py` is defensive: if `GPUTurboBackend.__init__` throws (e.g. `turboquant-gpu` not installed, CUDA driver missing, `cuda-tile` extras incompatible), it logs a warning and falls back to `CPUTurboBackend`. The service comes up either way — you'll just see `"backend": "cpu"` in `/health` and the CPU turbo-boost path (thread pinning + MKLDNN + 3-bit metrics probe) kicks in instead.

### Security Notes (turboquant-service)

The turboquant-service is designed to run on a private Docker network behind the ai-backend proxy — it does not expose its own auth layer. A few hardening knobs are still worth knowing:

| Environment variable | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`  | `false` | When `true`, HuggingFace model repos can execute arbitrary Python on load (`AutoTokenizer` / `AutoModelForCausalLM` with `trust_remote_code=True`). Only opt in for models you fully trust. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`       | `*`     | Comma-separated list of allowed origins. Wildcard mode intentionally runs with `allow_credentials=False` (forbidden-by-spec combo otherwise); set an explicit list to enable credentialed CORS. |
| `DEVICE`             | `auto`  | Pinned by docker-compose to `${OPENCUTAI_AI_COMPUTE_MODE:-auto}` so the UI toggle drives it. `auto`/`cpu`/`cuda`/`mps` all accepted.                                  |

The service also validates all `model_id` inputs against the strict HuggingFace `org/name` pattern (rejects path traversal and control characters) and caps every request body field (`content`, `prompt`, `messages`) at a reasonable length to prevent memory-exhaustion DOS. The ai-backend's `POST /api/config/update` endpoint rejects any value containing newlines, carriage returns, or NUL bytes before writing to `.env`, so the compute-mode toggle can't be abused to smuggle arbitrary env vars.

### Self-Hosting

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker compose build --parallel
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).

## Self-Hosting Costs

OpenCut AI runs entirely on your own infrastructure — no per-seat fees, no API metering, no usage limits. The only cost is the server itself.
